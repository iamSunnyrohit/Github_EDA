# GitHub Trending Repositories Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset containing daily updates on trending GitHub repositories, focusing on key metrics such as stars, forks, and repository descriptions. The aim is to identify trends in popular projects across various programming languages, providing insights into developer preferences and emerging technologies. Through data processing, cleaning, and visualization, we uncover patterns that can inform future development efforts and community engagement.

## Objectives

- Analyze trends in GitHub repositories based on daily updates.
- Identify popular programming languages and technologies.
- Provide insights into developer preferences and emerging trends.
- Evaluate the performance of different regression algorithms.

## Algorithms Used

In this project, we implemented the following machine learning algorithms to predict daily stars for GitHub repositories:

1. **Random Forest Regression**
2. **Linear Regression**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Tree Regression**

Each algorithm was evaluated for accuracy and performance, allowing us to compare their effectiveness in predicting repository popularity.
